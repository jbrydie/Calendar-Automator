# Calendar-Automator

Calendar Automator is a python script which calls the Google Calendar API and will display the events which I have in my calendar.
Current state functionality uses the color coding to determine what the type of activity is (i.e. Work, Travel, Gym, etc.). 

To use this sript all you have to do is follow https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python and click enable the google
calendar API. Store the JSON file in the same directory as the script and you're good to go.
