# Calendar-Automator

Calendar Automator is a python script which calls the Google Calendar API and will display the events which I have in my calendar.
Current state functionality uses the color coding to determine what the type of activity is (i.e. Work, Travel, Gym, etc.). Future state,
I will add a visualization aspect to display what each day will look like using pie charts, graphs, etc. to nicely display how much time
I have allocated to each activity during the day. 

To use this sript all you have to do is follow https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python and click enable the google
calendar API. Store the JSON file in the same directory as the script and you're good to go.
